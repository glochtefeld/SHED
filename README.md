# Stardew Heart Event Designer

This is the source code repository of SHED. It's still in a *very* alpha stage as of 2019-07-30, but that's hopefully
going to change!

If you have any questions about the repository, feel free to let me know. This project will be open source under the 
MIT license. 

## About
SHED is a utility for modders of the game [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net). It will allow users to create and edit
heart event data through a graphical user interface, so long as that data is in the JSON format. If you're looking to 
start using SHED and don't know how to access event data, take a look through the 
[Stardew Valley Wiki Page](https://www.stardewvalleywiki.com/Modding:Event_data) on the subject. When the project is complete, 
a series of video tutorials will be linked to this page as well.

## Credits
This project was originally designed, envisioned, and created by Gavin Lochtefeld (@lochga01). 
It is built with Java 12 and JavaFX 12, with heavy use of Scenebuilder. At some point, I'll take a UX design course,
 but today is not that day.
